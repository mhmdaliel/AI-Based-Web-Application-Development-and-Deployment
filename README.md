# AI-Based Web Application: Emotion Detection from Customer Feedback

This project implements an AI-based web application designed to analyze customer feedback text and determine the expressed emotion. It utilizes the Watson NLP library for emotion detection and Flask for web deployment.

## Scenario

As a software engineer hired by an e-commerce company, the goal was to create a web application that provides analytics on customer feedback for signature products. This Emotion Detection system helps understand customer sentiment beyond simple positive/negative analysis, extracting finer emotions like joy, sadness, and anger.

## Introduction

Emotion detection is crucial for AI-driven recommendation systems, chatbots, and other applications. This project demonstrates how to use embeddable AI libraries to build such a system.

## Project Guidelines and Tasks

This project was completed by following these tasks:

1.  **Fork and Clone the Project Repository:**
    * The project repository was forked and cloned to a local development environment.

2.  **Create an Emotion Detection Application using Watson NLP Library:**
    * The Watson NLP library was used to implement the core emotion detection functionality.

3.  **Format the Output of the Application:**
    * The output from the Watson NLP library was formatted for clear and user-friendly presentation.

4.  **Package the Application:**
    * The application was packaged for distribution and deployment.

5.  **Run Unit Tests on Your Application:**
    * Unit tests were implemented to ensure the application's reliability and correctness.

6.  **Deploy as Web Application using Flask:**
    * Flask was used to create a web interface for the emotion detection application.

7.  **Incorporate Error Handling:**
    * Error handling was implemented to manage invalid user inputs and other potential issues.

8.  **Run Static Code Analysis:**
    * Static code analysis was performed to ensure the code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines and maintains high code quality.

## Technologies Used

* **Watson NLP Library:** For emotion detection.
* **Flask:** For web application deployment.
* **Python:** Programming language.
* **Git:** For version control.
* **Unit Testing:** For software testing.
* **Static Code Analysis (PEP 8):** For code quality.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python3.11 server.py
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    * Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1.  Enter customer feedback text into the input field.
2.  Click the "Analyze" button.
3.  The application will display the detected emotion.

## Results

The application successfully analyzes customer feedback and accurately identifies the expressed emotions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of an AI-based web application for emotion detection using the Watson NLP library and Flask. Key skills developed include:

* Using embeddable AI libraries.
* Formatting AI output.
* Testing and packaging applications.
* Deploying web applications with Flask.
* Implementing error handling.
* Adhering to code quality standards (PEP 8).
